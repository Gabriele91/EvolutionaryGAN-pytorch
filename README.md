The author still working on improving the pytorch version and attempting to add more related functions to achieve better performance. Besides the proposed EGAN farmework, we also provide the [two_player_gan_model](https://github.com/WANG-Chaoyue/EvolutionaryGAN-pytorch/blob/master/models/two_player_gan_model.py) framework that contributes to integrating some existing GAN models together.
